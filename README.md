# RightClickTorch
A tiny Minecraft Forge mod that allows a player to easily right click to place a torch from anywhere in their inventory whilst holding either a pickaxe, shovel or axe.

Official binary (.jar) downloads for this mod are available exclusively on my website, http://www.binarycraft.uk/
